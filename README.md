## What is UniFinder?
UniFinder is a data visualization chart that pulls from a dataset containing 400+ public and private college universities in the United States. This interactive visualization aggregrates data on each college's median debt, mean earnings 8 years following entry, as well as more statistics including admission rate, relative undergraduate population, and geographical region. 

## Why Use UniFinder?
If you are a student seeking admission in any public or private university, this visualization can help you find a college/university that suits all of your preferences, whether it be geographical location, undergraduate population, or admission rate. If you are looking more into the financial aspect of collegiate education, this tool will also help you find data on the median debt after graduation, as well as the mean earnings achieved 8 years following entry of the university. Overall, UniFinder will give you a better idea of which college in the United States is best suited to your interests!
